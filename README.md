# Privacy Policy

**Thuiswerk** respects your privacy.

## Data Collection
Thuiswerk does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.  
All data you enter in the app is stored locally on your device.

## Data Usage
The data you enter is used solely to provide the app’s core functionality, such as tracking workdays, sending reminders, and exporting your records.

## Data Sharing
Thuiswerk does not share any data with third parties.  
No analytics, advertising, or tracking services are used.

## Data Security
Because all data remains on your device, you have full control over your information.  
Removing the app will also remove all stored data.

## Changes
If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be made available with the app.

## Contact
If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can contact the developer via the App Store.
